          <h2>Workshop Aims and Scope</h2>
          <p>
            By offering <strong>courses and resources</strong>, learning platforms on the Web have been attracting <strong>lots of participants</strong>, and the interactions with these
            systems have generated a vast amount of <strong>learning-related data</strong>. Their collection, processing and analysis have promoted a significant growth of learning
            analytics and have opened up new opportunities for supporting and assessing <strong>educational experiences</strong>. To provide all the stakeholders involved in the educational
            process with a timely support, being able to <strong>understand learner's behavior</strong> and create models that provide <strong>data-driven decisions</strong> pertaining to
            the learning domain is a primary feature of modern online platforms. This workshop aims to present novel, high-quality, high-impact, original research results reporting the
            current state of the art of online education systems empowered with <strong>data mining</strong> (DM) and <strong>machine learning</strong> (ML). Specifically, this workshop
            will pursue the following <strong>objectives</strong>:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Raise attention on education in the DM and ML community.</li>
            <li>Identify human aspects affected by DM and ML in education.</li>
            <li>Solicit contributions targeting DM and ML in education. </li>
            <li>Get insights on recent open issues and methods in this area.</li>
            <li>Expose gaps between research and actual needs in this area.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Given the growing importance of these topics, the DM and ML community is more and more eager to delve into this applicative domain and, as a consequence, can strongly benefit
            from a <strong>dedicated event</strong>. For this reason, this workshop would provide the WSDM community with rich, yet clear, focused, and well-structured insights on this
            domain. L2D 2021 will be the WSDM's workshop aimed at collecting new contributions in education-related data mining and at providing a common ground for <strong>interested
            researchers and practitioners</strong>. Given also the current situation faced by education worldwide due to the <strong>pandemic</strong>, we expect that this workshop will
            foster a strong outcome and a <strong>wide community dialog</strong>.

    <section id="submission" class="wow fadeInUp section-with-bg">

      <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="section-header">

          <h2>Submission Details</h2>

          <p>The submissions must be in English and adhere to the CEUR-WS one-column <a href=" http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip" target="_blank">template</a>. The papers should be
             submitted as PDF files to Easychair at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=l2d2021" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=l2d2021</a>. Please
             be aware that at least one author per paper must be registered and attend the workshop to present the work.</p>

          <p>We will consider four different submission types:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Papers (10-12 pages) </strong> should be clearly placed with respect to the state of the art and state the contribution of the proposal in the
                domain of application, even if presenting preliminary results. In particular, research papers should describe the methodology in detail, experiments should be repeatable,
                and a comparison with the existing approaches in the literature is encouraged. </li>
            <li><strong>Reproducibility Papers (10-12 pages) </strong> should repeat prior experiments using the original source code and datasets to show (i) how, why, and when the methods
                work or not, (ii) or should repeat prior experiments, preferably using the original source code, in new contexts (e.g., different domains and datasets, different evaluation
                and metrics) to further generalize and validate or not previous work.</li>
            <li><strong>Short Papers (5-9 pages) </strong> should describe significant novel work in progress. Compared to full papers, their contribution may be narrower in scope, be
                applied to a narrower set of application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected for a full paper. Submissions likely to generate discussions in new and
                emerging areas of data mining and machine learning in education are encouraged. </li>
            <li><strong>Position Papers (4-5 pages) </strong> should introduce new point of views in the workshop topics or summarize the experience of a group in the field. Practice and
                experience reports should present in detail real-world scenarios in which data mining and/or machine learning are exploited in the educational context. </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Submissions should not exceed the indicated number of pages, including any diagrams and references.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each submission will be reviewed by <strong>three independent reviewers</strong> on the basis of relevance for the workshop, novelty/originality, significance, technical quality
            and correctness, quality and clarity of presentation, quality of references and reproducibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            The accepted papers and the material generated during the meeting will be available on the workshop website. The workshop proceedings will be sent for inclusion in a
            <strong>CEUR-WS volume</strong> and consequently indexed on <strong>Google Scholar, DBLP, and Scopus</strong>. Authors of selected papers
            may be invited to submit an extended version in a journal special issue.
          </p>

          <p>
            We expect authors, the programm committee, and the organizing committee to adhere to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/acm-conflict-of-interest-policy" target="_blank">
            ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics" target="_blank">ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
